1. How would you define Machine Learning?
Answer:Machine Learning is a field of AI where computers learn patterns from data and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
Answer:Image recognition

Speech recognition
Answer: Recommendation systems 
        Fraud or spam detection

3. What is a labeled training set?
Answer:A labeled training set is a dataset where each input has a correct output (label) attached to it.

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Answer:Classification, Regression

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
Answer: Clustering
        Dimensionality reduction
        Anomaly detection
        Association rule learning

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
Answer: Reinforcement Learning

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
Answer: Unsupervised learning (clustering)

8. Would you frame spam detection as supervised or unsupervised learning?
Answer: Supervised learning, because emails are labeled as spam or not spam.

9. What is an online learning system?
Answer: An online learning system learns continuously, updating the model as new data arrives.

10. What is out-of-core learning?
Answer: Out-of-core learning is used when the dataset is too large to fit in memory, so data is processed in small chunks.

11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
Answer: Instance-based (or memory-based) learning, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter?
Answer: Model parameter: learned from data (weights)
        Hyperparameter: set before training (learning rate)

13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for?
Answer: They search for the best model parameters that minimize error.
        Strategy: optimization (gradient descent)
        Prediction: apply the learned model to new data

14. Can you name four main challenges in Machine Learning?
Answer: Insufficient training data
        Poor-quality data
        Overfitting
        Underfitting

15. If your model performs great on training data but poorly on new data, what is happening?

Answer: Overfitting
        Three solutions:
            Get more training data
            Reduce model complexity
            Use regularization

16. What is a test set, and why use it?
Answer: A test set is used only at the end to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

17. What is the purpose of a validation set?
Answer: To tune hyperparameters and compare models during development.

18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?
Answer: A train-dev set is used when training and test data come from different distributions. It helps diagnose whether poor performance is due to overfitting or data mismatch.
